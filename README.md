# Pitalium Optimization

### Reduce DiffPoints Union Time.
Using tree structure with x coordinate instead of 1:1 comparison.
Check whether each node is close to new node or not throgh the way of going down.
Using hashset structure to store closed pointes group(this will be MarkerGroup).
Using hashmap structure to store minimum and maximum of x, y coordinate.
